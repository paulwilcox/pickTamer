To load, do the following:
- Open edge, go to edge://extensions/
- Turn the switch for "Developer Mode"
- Click "Load unpacked"
- Navigate to the the parent folder for this readme file.

Be sure to reload any webpage you want to test with.  
Also, if you make code changes, be sure reload the webpage and also to click "reload" in the installed extension.
